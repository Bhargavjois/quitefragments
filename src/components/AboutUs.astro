      quitefragments wasn’t built all at once. It started like most things do—quietly. A line in the margins of a notebook. A scene that showed up out of nowhere and refused to leave. A sentence that felt too sharp, too strange, or too honest for anywhere else.
    </p>
    <p>
      Over time, those scraps—those fragments—kept piling up. They didn’t fit neatly into categories. Some were stories with clear beginnings and messy ends. Others were just moments: two people talking under a broken streetlight, someone standing at the edge of a decision, silence that says too much. None of them were trying to be perfect. They were trying to feel real.

      This blog is where those fragments go to breathe.

      You won’t find formulas here. There are no genre boxes to check, no promises of tidy resolutions. What you will find is fiction that cares more about the pulse under the surface than the polish on top. Characters who aren’t always sure what they want. Narratives that bend a little sideways. Pieces that start as whispers and end with something you can’t quite shake.

      quitefragments is a collection of stories, but also a mood—a place for anyone who likes their fiction a little raw, a little offbeat, a little too much in all the right ways.

      Stay as long as you like. Read in order or don’t. Come back when you need something that feels a little different.

      The fragments are waiting.
